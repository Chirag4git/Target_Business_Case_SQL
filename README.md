# Target_Business_Case_SQL

SQL is the backbone of data analysis and management in the modern era. By working through this case study, I gain hands-on experience and practical skills in manipulating and querying databases, which are fundamental to extracting insights from large volumes of data.
Solving this particular case study will help in developing proficiency in constructing complex SQL queries and understanding real-world data scenarios.

The data is available in 8 different csv files:
1. customers.csv
2. geolocation.csv
3. order_items.csv
4. payments.csv
5. reviews.csv
6. orders.csv
7. products.csv
8. sellers.csv

From this dataset I extracted insights and provided actionable recommendations in the form of pdf.
